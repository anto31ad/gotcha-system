# Todo

## Planned

- docs: document how to exit from the program safely 
- feat: ability to blacklist user when processing event (add it to facts.pl)
- feat: menu option to delete history (es. facts.pl)

## Ideas

- decide if `past-decisions.csv` logic can be used in the future or if it needs to be removed
- reason on sequence of operations (es. `login -> edit -> logout`)
- ability to add and reason on new user operations (es. `comment`, `like`, `share`, etc)
- feat: when typing a wrong command, display the error message in a way the previous print (es. event info) stays still.
- [ ] A containered image of gatcha system to make it easier to try it out
